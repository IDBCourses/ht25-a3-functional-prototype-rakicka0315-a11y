/*
 * Assignment 3: Functional Prototype
 * ----------------------------------
 * Programming 2025, Interaction Design Bachelor, MalmÃ¶ University
 * 
 * This assignment is written by:
 * Bozena Rakicka
 * 
 * 
 * The template contains some sample code exemplifying the template code structure.
 * You should use the structure with `state`, `settings`, `setup`, `update`, and `use`. 
 * `scale` and `toAbsolute` are very helpful in data processing.
 * 
 * For instructions, see the Canvas assignment: https://mau.instructure.com/courses/11936/assignments/84965
 * You might want to look at the Assignment examples for more elaborate starting points.
